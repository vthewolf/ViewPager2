This project contains a main view with a navigation button to another view formed by a ViewPager2 that shows a series of contents and wrapped in a SwipeRefreshLayout to update this view.
A dot indicator is also added to show the ViewPager2 page:
- master: dot indicator with external library.
- native-dot-indicator: dot indicator made natively.
